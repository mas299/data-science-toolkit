This is where we add some text to explain what's what and why we're doing this and stuff. This becomes metadata for the slide and it documents the code.

### Introduction and Outline

1. Why do we care about data?
1. What do we mean by _Data Science_?
1. Describing the _Industrial Data Flow_
1. Resources for your next steps

---

### Themes

* Ecosystems of tools 
 - Open Source ecosystem
 - Windows ecosystem
* Relevance to _process_ steps
* Relevence to _big data_ 
 - yah, we know you were thinking about it...
 - ...sigh...

### Why Do We Care About Data?


****

### These slides go down


*** 

### And This, Too

* Any slide under three astrisks is another verticle slide
* End it (start the next horizontal slide) with three dashes

### Like this...

### Data Science

Data science is _NOT_ just a new name for statistics, but a confluence of

1. Statistics
1. Programming
1. Subject-matter Expertise

****

### Stats

* Right tool for the job
 - Friends don't let friends use Excel for stats
* OS Ecosystem:
 - R, Python, Octave
* $ Ecosystem:
 - Revolution R, SAS/JMP, Matlab
* Windows Ecosystem:
 -R, Python, 

<small> source</small>

*** 

### Programming

* *nix environments (OSX, Linux)
 - C/C++, 
 - R (RCPP package)
 - Python
 - JavaScript (Node)
 - Never seen anything done in ObjectiveC
* Windows
 - C#
 - VB.Net
 
***

### Subject-Matter Expertise

* What to calculate, what it means
* 

---

### Process

* Inputs
* Clean
* Explore
* Model
* Products

--- &vertical

### Process Inputs

* Data Sources
* Big data 
* Provenance

*** 

### Sources

* Accessibility
* Freedom

***

### Big Data

* Flows
* Map-Reduce
* Importance of _repeatable_ processes
* Documenting processes 

*** 

### Provenance

* What have you got
* Where did it come from
* Where did they get it

--- &vertical

### Cleaning Data

* Standardization
* Missing values
* 

*** 

### Standardization

* Dealing with typos and differences
 - Who worked on this briefing?
  - CW Dillon
  - Clarence W Dillon
  - C. W. Dillion
 - (FI {+ iff MI} + Levenstein distance < 3 in Lastname)
* Translating Units of Measure
* 
 
--- &vertical

### Explore Data

* Exploratory 
* Exploratory visualization
* Volume (size and extent)
* Shape

***

### Shape and Volume

* Format 
 - Open formats: CSV, TSV, XML
 - Closed formats: .DTA, .SAS, .XLS(X)
* Shape
 - Long, sparse
 - Tabular, nested
* 

***
 
### Exploratory Viz

* Lattice
* Interactive 

***

### Exploratory Stats

* Auto Regression
* Measures of central tendency

***

### Problems with Summary Stats

### Models & Analysis

* This is the 'secret sauce' for your data product
* 

***

### Regression

* What matters?


***

### Fit

* Quality control

--- &vertical

### Product

* Reproducable research
* Sharing code & data
 - PDFs of tables are cruel and thwart the cause of science
 - PowerPoint is where data goes to die
* If you're product is good, it deserves an API

***

### Reproducable research

* You care because you value your own time/data
* ...or don't you?
* Share the code as well as the data
* 


***

### Data Products

* Think of this as the packaging step for manufactured products
* Documentation
* 

***

### APIs

* What
* Why
* How
 - automated API tools
